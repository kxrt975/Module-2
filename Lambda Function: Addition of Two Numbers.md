# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers
# ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that defines a lambda function which takes two arguments a and b, and returns their sum.

# ðŸ§  Algorithm
Get two integer inputs from the user.
Use a lambda function to define a function f that returns a + b.
Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.
# ðŸ§¾ Program
```
i=int(input())
j=int(input())
z=int(input())

f = lambda a, b,c: a+b+c

print(f(i, j,z))
```

# Result
Thus,the Python program that defines a lambda function which takes two arguments a and b, and returns their sum is created successfully.
